      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        ¿¿ I am an avid learner and researcher. I use GitHub to harness my
        programming and research skills and contribute to important projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        ¿¿¿ I read a lot. I write a lot. I read research papers, blogs, news
        articles, and non-fiction books. In my free (and in my not-so-free
        time), I write on blogs, magazines, forums, and all platforms where my
        voice can be shared and flourish.
      </p>
      <p>
        ¿ Programming as a Hobby, and building projects for fun. My primary
        programming languages include Python, Lua, C/C++, and Javascript. For
        research, I work with R, LaTeX, and Matlab.
      </p>
      <p>
        ¿ Believes in the power of open-source projects that induce
        collaboration and community-driven initiatives. I believe that Open
        Source and Collaboration catalyse the rate of advancements.
      </p>
      <p>
        ¿ Constantly learning and striving to improve. I am competing with
        myself to become better at my art.
      </p>

      <h2>Technical Skills</h2>
      <p>
        My interest changes and evolves with time. I experiment a lot with
        languages and tech stack, so expect this section to get updated every
        now and then.
      </p>
      <p>Here are a few technical skills which I currently possess:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Frontend: HTML5 / CSS3, React</li>
        <li>Backend: Python, Lua, NodeJS</li>
        <li>Database: MySQL</li>
        <li>Unix: Debian and Ubuntu</li>
        <li>Research: R, Matlab, LaTeX, Markdown</li>
        <li>CLI: Bash / Shell Scripts</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The Tech and Open Source Community buzzes all the time with innovations,
        news, surprises, drama, and (at times) remarkable advancements. I just
        get my hands dirty and play a lot.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="software">
      <h2>Software Skills</h2>
      <p>
        As mentioned before, I experiment a lot. I have listed the software ¿
        both Open Source and Closed ¿ that I use every now and then:
      </p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Purpose</th>
          <th>Tools</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Programming</td>
          <td>NeoVim, VSCode, Sublime, Jupyter, Quarto</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Media Editing</td>
          <td>
            Adobe Tools (Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, etc.), Inkscape
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>3D and CAD</td>
          <td>Blender, Solidwork</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Game Dev</td>
          <td>GoDot</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Notetaking</td>
          <td>Obsidian, LaTeX, MSOffice, Google Workspace Tools</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Virtual Machine</td>
          <td>VMWare Workstation Pro</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Research</td>
          <td>Zotero, LaTeX, R Studio, Jupyter, Matlab</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
        I usually use these tools in conjunction, even though this seems like an
        exhaustive list. This is not a complete list, obviously, for I am quite
        fuzzy about working with many tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, you can see I have more than one type of text editor for
        programming. But each has its own uses. I find Neovim quite good for
        programming, but VSCode has somewhat better support for collaboration.
        Sublime is also surprisingly fast to run with low startup times in a
        small portable non-cli environment.

      <h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        All the tools and skills mentioned here play a great role in my
        research, learning, and programming endeavors. This is not a complete
        list since I work with new projects every now and then. I regularly try
        out new applications and get rid of the old ones.
      </p>
      <p>In the end, my goal is simple:</p>
      <div class="quote">

          <b

              >I aspire to be the light of the world, and leave a bright
              positive impact behind as my legacy.</i
            ></b
          >
